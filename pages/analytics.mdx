# Feedback Analytics Dashboard

This page demonstrates the feedback analytics system built into the documentation.

## How It Works

The feedback widget appears at the bottom of every documentation page, allowing users to:

1. **Rate the page** with thumbs up or thumbs down
2. **Provide comments** explaining their feedback (optional)
3. **Track satisfaction** across all documentation pages

All feedback is stored locally in this demo (in production, it would be sent to an analytics backend).

## Privacy & Data

- Feedback is anonymous and does not collect personal information
- Only page paths, ratings, and optional comments are stored

## Implementation Details

The feedback system includes:

- **PageFeedback Component**: Embedded in every page footer

- **Analytics Aggregation**: Real-time statistics per page
- **Satisfaction Metrics**: Percentage-based helpfulness scores
- **Recent Feedback Log**: Chronological view of submissions
